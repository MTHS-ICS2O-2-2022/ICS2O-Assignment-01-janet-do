    <h1> Alan Turing- The father of Modern computer science</h1>
    <h3>"A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human"</h3>
  <p class="dashed">Alan Turing, (born June 23, 1912, London, Eng.—died June 7, 1954, Wilmslow, Cheshire), English mathematician and
  logician. He studied at the University of Cambridge and at Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study. He has made
  many contributions to artificial intelligence, computer science and aided in WW2 by breaking German naval codes including the famous Enigma machine.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the war, Turing worked at the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, where he led a team of
  codebreakers in decrypting messages encrypted by the German Enigma machine. Turing's work helped to break the German
  Enigma code, which had been considered unbreakable, and provided the Allies with invaluable intelligence on German
  military operations. The code-breaking effort at Bletchley Park is estimated to have shortened the war in Europe by two
  to four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the years following World War II, Turing became interested in the idea of creating machines that could mimic human
  intelligence. He developed the concept of the Universal Turing Machine, a theoretical model of a machine that could
  perform any computation that could be performed by a human being.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite his significant contributions to the war effort and to the field of computing, Turing was persecuted by the
  British government for his homosexuality, which was then considered a criminal offense. He was convicted of indecency in
  1952 and forced to undergo chemical castration. Turing died by suicide in 1954, and his legacy was not fully recognized
  until decades later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Today, Turing is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of computing and a hero of the war
  effort. His work continues to inspire researchers and developers in fields ranging from artificial intelligence to
  cryptography to computer science.
